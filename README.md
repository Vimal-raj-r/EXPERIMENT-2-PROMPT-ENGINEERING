# EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

## Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

## Algorithm:
1. Choose a test scenario
2. Apply different prompting techniques:
   1. Broad/Unstructured Prompt
   2. Basic/Clearer Prompt:

## Test Scenario & Prompts:
### Scenario 1: Factual Information (Technology)
### Broad/Unstructured Prompt:

### Scenario 2: Creative Writing (Modern Fiction)
### Broad/Unstructured Prompt:

<img width="878" height="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7214cc25-f9e9-4546-abb5-bff2f788da06" />

### Scenario 3: Problem Solving/Logic (Personal Finance)
### Broad/Unstructured Prompt:
<img width="907" height="261" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5a91ff2-5317-4050-aef7-b5a7fab4a393" />

### Basic/Clearer Prompt:
<img width="885" height="751" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2e309d-a0c7-42c0-99e4-9e1186d7666e" />
<img width="859" height="765" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ebb6fe-8750-45d0-9da1-98ea54f25b86" />

### Scenario 4: Technical Task/Coding (Web Development)
### Broad/Unstructured Prompt:
<img width="827" height="262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b70d553-b2d8-46fc-8cc7-35ffcdc18881" />

### Basic/Clearer Prompt:
<img width="846" height="553" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5a79a24-30fe-4789-9f1e-ced4a8f4aafc" />

## Output:

### Prompt Type: Broad / Unstructured Prompt
1. Quality: High but varied — may include extra details beyond what was asked.
2. Accuracy: Generally accurate, but may cover more than necessary, risking minor irrelevance
3. Depth: Deep, exploratory, covers multiple dimensions of the topic.

### Prompt Type:Basic / Clearer Prompt
1. Quality: Very high — precise and aligned to the request.
2. Accuracy: High — tightly matches the specified information, minimizing off-topic details.
3. Depth: Moderate — focused depth limited to exactly what was asked.

## Result
Thus, the comparative analysis of different types of prompting patterns, explained with various test scenarios, has been successfully implemented.
